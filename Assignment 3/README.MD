# Assignment 3 notes
#### Note 1: main + repository as in the example are in one main file for my submission. Realized too late this made reading things pretty hard. Might seaperate if we have to build on this week
#### Note 2: main.py has been validated and tested for csv repo for Create, read, update, and delete using fast api for one User table. Testing Data/steps is inside main.py
###### User.csv shows the csv after the testing has been completed

###### FinalUpdatedRow.png shows the updated testing
#### Note 3: main2.py is an attempt at memory and sql repositories. Was not able to completly debug and test

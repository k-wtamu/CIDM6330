## Introduction 

##### A problem for which a designed software system could assist in improving or solving
As people are getting more used to companies tracking *(and using)* the meta data that is constantly being tracked in virtually every interaction we have, from any purchase with a debit or credit card to the streaming services and social media apps we use, it would be nice to see some additional benefits other than targeted ads. 
Additionally, with increasing use of smart technology I can see the application of new technologies that track items that enter your home and ones that help track consumption. A smart trashcan that can scan barcodes on boxes or image recognition to identify used items and subtract it off the current household inventory list. It would be an integrated software system to assist a persons non-virtual life. Easy tracking, searching, and accessing an array of household information. The specs and standards for all my appliances, a digital accounting of all the books, games, furniture *(including dimensions)*, stock of the items in your fridge, integration with your streaming services to track what you have watched, maintenance and replacement schedules, and the ability to integrate your smart assistant (Echo, Nest, Siri) to allow for voice communication, archive, and access for information. 
For very wealthy people, you could preauthorize purchases for items when it knows you are getting low. Or even have your home be [adaptive and reactive](https://news.mit.edu/2018/AI-identifies-people-indoor-smart-homes-1017#:~:text=When%20Betsy%20returns%20to%20the,monitoring%20and%20responsive%20smart%20homes.) to you. 

##### The domain of practice or interest in which this problem is situated
This would fit within the technology industry and computer science domain and could be utilized in people homes to make their lives easier, like a simpler version of [Jarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) , as an AI assistant that could help relieve the burden of running your home. 

#####  Your personal/professional interest in this problem domain
Personal interest would be to reduce mental burden of keeping up with daily life and responsibilities. It would allow me far more free time outside of work, where I don’t feel I need to get a hundred things done at every moment of my life. If integrated with your fridge or grocery purchases it could also help reduce food waste and excess in the house. 
I don’t need total efficiency in my life, but it would *(to reference the assignment description)* maximize the benefit of all my smart systems and devices in the house. 

#####  What sort of system you want to prototype that would allow you to better understand the problem, problem domain, or design considerations thereon.

__To scope this down for this class, I am focusing on the software architecture of a home task and maintenance management system.__

<mark> This prototype would be a basic home management system to send prescheduled and suggested tasks and inventory reminders to the user to check off as complete or schedule for later. Task and maintenance will be limited in this initial design to food and cleaning type household responsibilities. Eating and cleaning are two of the most basic functions in the household, and this projects protype will start here.</mark>

#### Gherkin Validation (Example Test Scenarios)

##### Feature: Store new food items in data structure/database

###### Scenario 1: Valid food item name non-duplicate entry

Given: The user has selected to enter in a food item name 

And the name does not already appear in the inventory

When: User enters a item name with character length is greater than 3 

And character length is less than 50

Then:  Food item name check against inventory list passes

And Food item name is saved into inventory as a new record 

And User is given a visual confirmation that the item is saved

###### Scenario 2:  Valid food item name duplicate entry - initial submission

Given: The user has selected to enter in a food item name

And the name already appear in the active inventory (Non archived/consumed)

When:  User enters a item name with character length is greater than 3 

And character length is less than 50

Then:  Food item name check against inventory list fails

And User is given a choice to add new duplicate item or cancel adding a duplicate food item


###### Scenario 2a: Valid food item name duplicate entry - user decides to cancel new food item

Given: User is trying to add a duplicate food item 

And the user has been prompted with the choice to add new duplicate item or cancel adding a duplicate food item

When: User selects canceling adding the new item

Then: User is given a visual confirmation that adding the food item has been cancelled


######  Scenario 2b: Valid food item name duplicate entry - user decides to add duplicate new food item

Given: User is trying to add a duplicate food item 

And the user has been prompted with the choice to add new duplicate item or cancel adding a duplicate food item

When: User selects to duplicate the food item

Then: Food item name is saved into inventory as a new record 

And User is given a visual confirmation that the item is saved


######  Scenario 3: Invalid food item name - too few characters

Given: The user has selected to enter in a food item name 

And the name does not already appear in the inventory

When: User enters a item name with character length is less than 3 

Then: User is given a visual invalid Food Name warning 


######  Scenario 4: Invalid food item name - too many characters

Given: The user has selected to enter in a food item name 

And the name does not already appear in the inventory

When: User enters a item name with character length is greater than 50

Then: User is given a visual invalid Food Name warning

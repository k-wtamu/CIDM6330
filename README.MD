Introduction 

##### A problem for which a designed software system could assist in improving or solving
As people are getting more used to companies tracking *(and using)* the meta data that is constantly being tracked in virtually every interaction we have, from any purchase with a debit or credit card to the streaming services and social media apps we use, it would be nice to see some additional benefits other than targeted ads. 
Additionally, with increasing use of smart technology I can see the application of new technologies that track items that enter your home and ones that help track consumption. A smart trashcan that can scan barcodes on boxes or image recognition to identify used items and subtract it off the current household inventory list. It would be an integrated software system to assist a persons non-virtual life. Easy tracking, searching, and accessing an array of household information. The specs and standards for all my appliances, a digital accounting of all the books, games, furniture *(including dimensions)*, stock of the items in your fridge, integration with your streaming services to track what you have watched, maintenance and replacement schedules, and the ability to integrate your smart assistant (Echo, Nest, Siri) to allow for voice communication, archive, and access for information. 
For very wealthy people, you could preauthorize purchases for items when it knows you are getting low. Or even have your home be [adaptive and reactive](https://news.mit.edu/2018/AI-identifies-people-indoor-smart-homes-1017#:~:text=When%20Betsy%20returns%20to%20the,monitoring%20and%20responsive%20smart%20homes.) to you. 

##### The domain of practice or interest in which this problem is situated
This would fit within the technology industry and computer science domain and could be utilized in people homes to make their lives easier, like a simpler version of [Jarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) , as an AI assistant that could help relieve the burden of running your home. 

#####  Your personal/professional interest in this problem domain
Personal interest would be to reduce mental burden of keeping up with daily life and responsibilities. It would allow me far more free time outside of work, where I don’t feel I need to get a hundred things done at every moment of my life. If integrated with your fridge or grocery purchases it could also help reduce food waste and excess in the house. 
I don’t need total efficiency in my life, but it would *(to reference the assignment description)* maximize the benefit of all my smart systems and devices in the house. 

#####  What sort of system you want to prototype that would allow you to better understand the problem, problem domain, or design considerations thereon.
This prototype would essentially be a very large Systems of Systems Integration effort with APIs and a database that a user can interact easily with. 
If this was not a school project I would need to compare specifications and connection between currently available smart home devices and understand the legal feasibility of collecting and utilizing the needed data from the smart devices. Because my knowledge of current smart home devices is limited, I would need a lot of research into the currently and upcoming smart home appliances/systems. I would also need more about how inventory tracking systems store data, and research ones that are already available. Some [initial research](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/home-inventory-app-template) looks like there are home inventory systems that utilize barcode scanning and [additional *“research”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/sm2hih/home_inventory_management_system_ideas/)  shows there are “web-based self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home” through ERP solutions such as  [Grocy.](https://grocy.info/)
 I would also look for tools that utilize images and sensors to identify products like Amazons [“Just Walk Out technology”](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-just-walk-out-rfid-technology). I’m pretty sure at the airport recently, there was a small convenience store you placed your items on a large table scanner and scale that determined what item you were trying to buy. As this technology gets cheaper and more reasonable to have in your home there is even more potential. 

__*To scope this down for this class, I would like to focus on the software architecture for an home inventory system.*__

-  SMART DRAW?
-  Since we will be working with software, please create a Github account if you do not already have one. 
-  Then, create a respository on Github that you will use for the course. I would call it CIDM6330-Spring2025
-  Within that repository, create a folder called "Assignment 1"
-  Create a file called "README.MD" and place all content for your Requirements Specification there.
-  The content must be formatted as MARKDOWN (Markdown Cheat Sheet | Markdown Guide)
-
